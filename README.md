# diabetes_prediction
diabetes-prediction using machine learning. 
## About project
The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic center
and consulting doctor. But the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical
problem. The motive of this study is to design a model which can prognosticate the
likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy.
<br>
-> Therefore, machine learning classification algorithms namely Decision Tree, SVM
and Naive Bayes can be used to detect diabetes at an early stage. We used data mining
methods like Logistic regression.
<br>
-> Experiments are performed on Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIMA) which is
sourced from UCI machine learning repository. The performances of all the three
algorithms are evaluated on various measures like Precision, Accuracy. Accuracy is
measured over correctly and in correctly classified instances. Results obtained the
highest accuracy of 76.30% comparatively other algorithms.
<br>
-> I also deployed this model on Django with a user interface to make it attractive and
profound.
<br>
-> It is a full fledged webapp which can predict if a person is diabetic or not with some
parameters.
